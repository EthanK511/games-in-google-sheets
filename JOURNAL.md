## 10/20/2025 12:03 PM - Learn how to use Google apps script and cell functions.  

During this project, I learned how to use Google Apps Script and advanced cell functions in Google Sheets to create interactive and dynamic spreadsheets. I relied heavily on the online developer tools provided by Google, experimenting with the built-in script editor, logging tools, and real-time debugging features. Much of my learning came through trial and error, testing different formulas, scripts, and workflows until I understood how to manipulate data, trigger events, and create custom functions. This process not only taught me the technical aspects of Google Sheets automation but also strengthened my problem-solving skills, patience, and ability to troubleshoot in a live development environment.
